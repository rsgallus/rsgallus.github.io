# Ryan Gallus
This is a simple GitHub Pages website at the domain [ryangallus.me](www.ryangallus.me).


## Development
I put together this website as a project, using free resources available online and from the GitHub Student Developer Pack. The domain name was provided by Namecheap, and an encrypted connection is powered by Kloudsec. The page itself is built with Bootstrap.
