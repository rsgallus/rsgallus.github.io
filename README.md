This is a simple GitHub Pages website at the domain [www.ryangallus.com](http://www.ryangallus.com).


## Development
I initially built this website as a project, using free resources available online and from the GitHub Student Developer Pack. Since then, I have turned it into a photography portfolio. The domain is provided by Namecheap and secure connection provided by Cloudflare.
