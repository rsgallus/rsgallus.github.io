                  <h2> Ryan Gallus - Computer Engineering Student </h2>
                  <p> Welcome to the Beta Alpha Chapter of Delta Sigma Phi fraternity!  Our chapter was started in the spring semester of 2014.  Starting with the unwavering support of 45 founding members, this Delta Sig chapter has grown into a prominent organization at Iowa State and continues                         to expand its presence here on our campus. </p>
                  <p> Within our chapter, you will find several successful and high-achieving men.  The range of academic specialties and other campus                                   organizations that our men are involved with embodies the mission of Delta Sigma Phi: to Build Better Men.  We strive to represent our                             chapter to the best of our ability, as well as become better leaders, students, future professionals, and citizens.</p>

                      <p id="prezText"> My name is Brendan O'Connor, and I haven't written this letter yet.  The following is copied from a Wikipedia article so we can see how the home page will look with more text on it.</p>
                      <p> At the end of the nineteenth century, most fraternities were exclusively Christian or Jewish, and barred membership to individuals on the basis of religion. When a group of friends at the City College of New York tried to join a fraternity, they were denied membership because their group was composed of Christians and Jews. In response, they organized the first chapter of Delta Sigma Phi on December 10, 1899. The chapter was called Insula due to the chapter's location in Manhattan. In late 1902, with five members from Insula signing incorporation papers, Delta Sigma Phi was incorporated with the purpose to spread "the principles of friendship and brotherhood among college men, without respect to race or creed." By 1903 the fraternity had established chapters at Columbia University and New York University. However even though they were a Jewish and Christian fraternity, there were a few chapters who did not mix. In 1909, eight Jewish men sought membership in the Columbia chapter of Delta Sigma Phi, and were denied it. These men then founded Phi Sigma Delta. </p>
                      <p> I think it's safe to say the home page looks good.  It will be especially nice when I, Brendan O'Connor, actually write this later.  To all my brothers, YITBOS.</p>
