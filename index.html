        <h2> About Me </h2>
        <p> Currently a senior in computer engineering and a second year concurrent graduate student, I grew up in Ames, Iowa and attended Gilbert High School. While in school, I was involved in Cross Country, Track, Student Council, National Honors Society, Band, Choir, and a leadership organization called Family, Career, and Community Leaders of America (FCCLA). </p>
        <p> After graduating high school in the spring of 2013, I began pursuing a degree from Iowa State University. On campus, I became involved in a number of organizations and leadership opportunities. I participated in Dance Marathon and served on the recruitment committee, worked as a Community Adviser in the residence halls, founded a chapter of Delta Sigma Phi Fraternity, got involved with the university Honors Program, and serve as a Student Admissions Representative. </p>
        <p> While attending university, I also gained work experience. During my freshman year, I worked for the Iowa Department of Transportation as a Software Developer in Geospatial Technologies. The summer following my sophomore year, I completed a Software Engineering internship with Cerner in Kansas City, Missouri. After my junior year, I began working as a Software Engineering Intern at IBM in Rochester, Minnesota, where I continued to work part-time remotely from ISU. This past summer, I worked as a Project Management Intern at Boeing. </p>

            <h4 class="text-primary"> Pilot Biometrics </h4>
            <p> For Senior Design class, my team was tasked with developing a pilot biometrics system to capture ECG waveforms. The goal of the system is to monitor pilot health in flight and alert pilots when they are at risk of falling unconscious. We were given an ARM M7 microprocessor card, a medical-grade ECG sensor, and wireless electrodes. With this, my team was asked to set up a UNIX environment, design a filter for the ECG to achieve a high degree of fidelity, write an algorithm for analyzing the sensor data, write device drivers for the hardware, design circuit components to connect hardware, and develop a mechanical harness to mount the sensors. </p>

            <p> One of my major tasks while working for IBM was to completely overhaul an outdated sample application called Plants by WebSphere. This involved removing the old Java Server Pages and Java Server Faces design, and rebuilding the application as a RESTful web service. In addition to these changes, I also redesigned the user interface to scale to display size. The project was done completely open source, so you can see the latest changes on GitHub. </p>

            <p> While working as an intern at Cerner, I participated in a hackathon event. My team and I created an Android application called RoomMe that helps connect potential roommates based on their location and data from their Facebook profile. I implemented Facebook login and the backend server/database that stores data from Facebook. Our team had a very short period of time to produce this application, so communication and teamwork were critical. We used Git for version control and GroupMe to communicate. In the end, our project won first place. </p>

            <p> As part of a semester-long software development class, my team and I developed a platform called Game Connect that allows you to pair your phone with your computer to play games using your mobile phone as a controller. I was in charge of the mobile app, which I built using Apache Cordova to create native Android and iOS applications. The application was developed with HTML and JavaScript, while the backend was written in Java. We used web sockets for connectivity and Dart for the PC client frontend. At the end of the semester, our design was nominated for best project. </p>

            <p> At the Iowa Department of Transportation, I developed a web application that plots the locations of Iowa DOT snow plows in real time. Each snow plow was fitted with a GPS unit that sends data to an Oracle Spatial database. Using location data and the ESRI ArcGIS Online API, I developed an interactive JavaScript web application. The application allows anyone to view the locations of snowplows and even view dash-camera footage of snow plows as they are working, which helps travelers predict the condition of snowy roads. </p>
